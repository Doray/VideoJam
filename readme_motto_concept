The idea is yet only an starting point 
--
When seeing a jam session with improvising jazz musicians,
is it possible to move this into this century?
Would it, while using new ways, be possible to ditch the sound and just focus on the visual?

Lets try to make an enviroment where visual artist can communicate by means of their animations and react with one another.
This project is the start of that journey.
